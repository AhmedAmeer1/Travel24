                <h1>Perks </h1>
                <p>
                    With many large ride-hailing companies failing to provide their drivers with everything they need to
                    feel safe, secure, and satisfied in their profession, many drivers have reasonably come to expect
                    very little in the way of job perks.
                    However, you can expect a lot more as an Addison Lee Driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the benefits of driving with us:
                </p>


                <h1>Pay </h1>
                <p>
                    At 24 hours taxi, we offer our customers a range of different services, meaning these differences
                    carry through to you, the driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While most ride-hailing and taxi companies give their drivers little or no choice regarding the type
                    of service they provide customers, with Addison Lee, the decision lands with you. That means you can
                    expect more freedom and more ways to find a service that you’re
                    passionate about.
                </p>



                <h1>Wait Times </h1>
                <p>
                    Many people expect a lot of drivers’ time will be spent waiting or searching for jobs. Addison Lee
                    is different. We are the UK’s largest private hire, Black Taxi, and same-day delivery company,
                    completing over 4,500 jobs daily in London alone.
